//! A frame rate as the fraction of whole numbers that encoder parameters and bitstream timing
//! take, read from the `f64` a capture carries.
//!
//! A caller names a rate by its fraction, carried as the `f64` of that fraction: the NTSC rates
//! are `N * 1000 / 1001` (59.94 is 60000/1001), which no whole number or decimal names. The
//! fraction nearest the `f64` with a denominator up to `MAX_DENOMINATOR` is that fraction
//! exactly, since any other in reach lies at least a millionth of a frame per second away, far
//! past an `f64`'s error. A rate written with up to three decimals reads as its own decimal
//! fraction, and any other rate as the nearest fraction in reach, within a thousandth of a frame
//! per second.

/// The largest denominator a rate is read with: 1001 holds every NTSC rate and every rate
/// written with up to three decimals.
